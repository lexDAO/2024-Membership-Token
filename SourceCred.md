# SourceCred as passive activity temp check

## Analytics and Privacy
LexDAO liek many other orgs has a conundrum in that it respects the privacy of its members yet strives to improve functionality. In furtherance (as per constitution Section 1.2 balancing deterministic tools and equitable considerations) we hope to entrench the following design principles
- differential privacy - should only permit details at a macro-scale, with granularity impossible to identify individudals or closely connected groups
- opt-out (members) or opt-in (guests) to allow individual participation in the statistical profiling 
- independent review of the uses of the data-driven outcomes to ensure non-discrimination abd appropriate data destruction

The general economic incentive is along cooperative principles ... any surplus generated on the common platform be returned to members (zero-profit) in propertion to activity or to subsidise community events (eg pot-latch events). SourceCred is the (supposedly) impartial mechanism to determine such activity in a handsoff fashion which is:
1. neutral ... the graph weights and algorithm is open (but subject to revision/refinement)
2. passive ... no human intervention or biases except when correcting unanticipated circumstances
3. automated ... to the point where it reduces the administrative overheads and allow scaling to >10k members

## Desired Behaviour

1. Contribution to collective assets (guthub repo)
   - Assets
   - Design Assets incl wiki
   - Media Assets incl YouTube, substack (⚔️LexNews+⚖️) and other publications
   - Constitution, Operating Handbook, hackMD (adm discussions)
2. Participation in social media (currently discord)
   - discord submission of interesting links and articles
   - cotnribution to mentorship, and general guidance to guests
   - citing LexDAO as source of thought-leadership
3. Monetary+Technical Support
   - increasing automation and bug-squishing
   - value appreciation in curating ideas and preference voting for proposals
   - and direct (US tax deductible) or in-kind donations are always appreciated 😙

 ## Plan (we have one instead of stumbling in dark?)

 😮‍💨Sorry to shatter your innate belief in OC perspicuity but this is going to be 摸着石头过河. There are likely to be 3-5 phases

 ```mermaid
timeline
  Experiment (alpha) : Install sourceCred
    : ☑️ prelim armitage.xyz
    : install discord plugin
  Design (beta) : Configure + CRED integration
  Tune (deploy) :  Play with weights to get srCRED
  Squabble (delta) : Argue whether right behaviour is incentivised
  Consensus : Eventual agreement and hands-off operation
```
