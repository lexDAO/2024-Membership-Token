# LexDAO MembershipToken

## EYE1

The legal possession of this `CRED` token is [recordat]() of the _social engagement_, skills, and side-projects of the owner. In conjunction with srCRED [^1] Â¿TBA?, it is LexDAO's assessment (passive and active/explicit voting) of participating in legal engineering activities including:
- POAP attendance in studygroups or hackerthons;
- TCR - indicating preference in token curated registries [^2] for an activity or priority;
- funded activities such as working for membership or gaining a levelup via hackathon quest.

## HOW2

An outline of the current workflow to deploy a simple custom ERC 721 NFT Token

> [!CAUTION]
> There will be progressive upgrade in the associated contracts ... currently by minting a new token every year, the information loses continuity so an important worktask is to find the right improvements in ERC721 such as handles and not pointers.

## WHO4
Only for paidup members (opt-out) and l'externs (mandatory). Guests are assumed by default to be anonymous (but can voluntarily opt-in) and will not participate in the srCRED measurement (though their impact may flow onto members as in popular choice voting for most popular mentor).

### Plan Framework and Concept
<!--- too much detail here, move into other files and just summarise in a protocol diagram -->

### Core Script Files
[LexDAO Token Generator](https://github.com/cimplylimited/file-processing-scripts)

### Base Minting Needs
  - [x] Create a json seed file for the NFT 
  - [x] Create an image seed file for the NFT
  - [x] Create a script to duplicate and increment the json seed file
  - [x] Create a script to increment the Token ID inside the json seed file
    - [ ] can this be done with a smart application using a smart contract or offline process?
    - [ ] ideal is for this to generate the file metadata at mint by interacting with an off-chain application 
  - [ ] Create a script to convert the NFT seed file to base-64
  - [x] Pull a template open-zepplin minting contract
  - [ ] Edit parameters of the open-zepplin minting contract to include
    - [ ] Enumeratability
    - [ ] Burn Function
    - [ ] Non-Transferrability
    - [ ] Time expiration
      - [ ] Considerations for the ERC-4907
        - Remember that in this standard the token remains the property of the origin rather than the "renter"
      - [ ] Second Consideration is to embed the token with a time value in the contract itself using a store variable in solidity.  Would like this to be an explicit value updateable by the admin minting wallet.    
  - [ ] Transfer ownership of the contract to the DAO Gnosis Safe for minting
    - [ ] This may be a sub-wallet with approvals or might be a full self-mint
    - [ ] Make sure to include conditions for one mint one wallet
    - [ ] Should we consider ERC-712 authentication?
  - [ ] Test Mint the token
  - [ ] Submit the code for membership review
  - [ ] Formally mint the token
  - [ ] Connect the token to snapshot
  - [ ] Audit the current 2022 membership token for expiration
  - [ ] Grandfather in relevant members per Operating System Document
  
## MUT8 Date Marker
The plan frameowork and concept were last updated 2023-03-08

## BOT9 - using lexy or kay to parse ruleset and passively trigger audits

We use the legal tests of:
- more likely than not
- on the balance of probabiliies
- beyond reasonable doubt

by running multiple discord bots and weighing their frame assessment to automate the central accounting problem.

### Contract Risk Checks
  In order to help begin the process of trying to minimize risk factors, the following are some checks that we will be trying to build into the contract mint protocol
  - [ ] OFAC Sanction List checks
  - [ ] Flash Loan vulnerabilities
    - [ ] Don't measure governance power in the current block
  - [ ] Check arbitrary data calls in governance
    - [ ] Check success conditions
    - [ ] Re-entrance issues
    - [ ] Return Data
    - [ ] EOA vs. Account with Code
  - [ ] Ensure that if you need a payer function there is a payer function
  - [ ] Beware of msg.values in batched actions
  - [ ] Build the use of delays and guardians
  - [ ] Perform security assessments (especially with upgrades)

 # Governance Considerations of Smart Contracts for DAO
 ! [Open Zepplin Presentation on Security Considerations](https://youtu.be/GbDAmMdmh8Q?feature=shared)
  - Considerations around Administrative Transfer of Powers
  - Ensuring a contract can be upgraded
  - Restrictions around Flash Loans of Governance Tokens
  - Delegation of Voting Power
    - Ensure that the membership can delegate its powers to allow others to continue to govern if they do not want to participate
  - Governance Bypass Functions
  - Whitelisting of Proposers
    - Allow users to propose things even if the proposer does not have governance tokens/power
  
  ## Best Practices
  -  Documentation on process for attack vectors the way that [Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/governance/adversarial-circumstances)
    - Proposals to exploit vulnerabilities
    - Collecting enough tokens to force malicious proposals through
    - Flashloans or spam governance
    - Bad Faith Proposals
  
  ## Types of Governance Artifacts
  - Improvement Proposals
    - Change a core function
  - Configuration Changes
    - Change a variable
    
  ## Governance Bodies
  - Mini DAOs can utilize different governance functions in a DAO
  - Guardian Multisig
    - A group that can cancel a transaction that is not in the best interest of the DAO
  
  ## Offchain Functional Considerations
